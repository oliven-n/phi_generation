Specifically, this package is designed to take in structured data (in the form of a csv), as well as style supplements.  In querying a non-RAG like ChatGPT, the model often inserts unwanted context (e.g., history of a medication or disease, or its other uses not related to the patient's needs) that does not reflect the tone of true doctor's notes. This tool is designed to mitigate those effects, or to assess the future need for fine-tuning an LLM on patient data."

The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the patient's medical history, current health status, and potential health concerns. The patient's medical information was obtained from a csv data file.\\n\\nRelevant Illness and Medication:\\n\\nJohn Smith has been diagnosed with hypertension and is currently taking medication to manage it. Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a common chronic condition that affects many adults worldwide. It is characterized by abnormally high blood pressure levels, which can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. John's current medication for hypertension is metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker commonly used to lower blood pressure.\\n\\nRelevant Illness and Medication:\\n\\nThe patient has also been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and is taking medication to control his blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. If left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney failure. John is currently taking metformin\\n\\n\\n\\nAnxiety is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of worry, fear, and unease. It often manifests in physical symptoms such as restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and tense muscles. It can also lead to avoidance behaviors and difficulty functioning in daily life. The patient has a history of anxiety and is currently taking medication to manage symptoms. The medication prescribed is [insert name], which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain. The patient reports some improvement in symptoms and is currently attending therapy sessions to address underlying causes of anxiety. Regular follow-up appointments are recommended to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\\n\\n\\n\\nBehavior refers to the actions and conduct of a patient, which can be affected by various factors such as mental health, environmental influences, and underlying medical conditions. In a patient's health record, behavior is often documented as a key component of their overall health and well-being. This includes any observed changes in behavior, such as increased agitation, aggression, or withdrawal. It can also refer to specific behaviors that may impact their health, such as smoking or substance abuse. Medications may be prescribed to manage and treat certain behaviors, such as antipsychotics for aggressive behavior or antidepressants for mood changes. Monitoring and addressing behaviors is crucial in providing comprehensive care for a patient and improving their overall health outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCannabis is a plant-based substance that is commonly used for its psychoactive and medicinal effects. In this patient's health record, it is noted that they have a history of using cannabis for recreational purposes. They report using it to help manage symptoms of anxiety and insomnia. The patient has not disclosed any adverse reactions or side effects from cannabis use. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of this information as it may impact the patient's response to certain medications and treatments. Regular cannabis use may also increase the risk of developing respiratory issues and potential cognitive impairments. It is recommended that the patient's cannabis use is monitored and discussed with their healthcare team for appropriate management.\\n\\n\\n\\nCardio, short for cardiovascular, refers to the health of the heart and blood vessels. It is an important aspect of a patient's health record as it can indicate their risk for heart disease and other related conditions. In this context, Cardio may refer to a condition or a medication prescribed to manage or treat cardiovascular issues. This can include high blood pressure, heart rhythm abnormalities, or heart failure. The medication prescribed for Cardio may vary depending on the specific condition and severity of the patient's cardiovascular health. It is important for healthcare providers to closely monitor the patient's cardiovascular health and adjust treatment as needed to maintain good heart health. \"]\n",

      "  '\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nAs a doctor, it is essential to thoroughly understand a patient\\'s health history and current conditions in order to provide the best possible care. In this report, I will be analyzing the public health data of Patient X (assigned number 12345), a 55-year-old male. This data includes relevant information about the patient\\'s past and current illnesses as well as their prescribed medications. By examining this information, I will be able to gain a comprehensive understanding of the patient\\'s health and make any necessary recommendations for their care.\\n\\nDiabetes:\\nPatient X has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition that affects the body\\'s ability to regulate blood sugar levels. This condition is indicated by a \"1\" in the diabetes column of the data. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart disease, nerve damage, and vision problems. It is crucial for the patient to closely monitor their blood sugar levels and follow their prescribed treatment plan, which may include lifestyle changes, medication, and regular check-ups with their doctor.\\n\\nHypertension:\\nThe patient also has a history of hypertension, indicated by a \"1\" in the hypertension column. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that can increase the risk of heart disease,\\n\\n\\n\\nCardio, short for cardiovascular, refers to the health of the heart and blood vessels. In a patient health record, it may be used to describe a condition or medication related to the heart and blood vessels. This could include a diagnosis of a cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease or high blood pressure, or the use of medications to treat these conditions such as beta blockers or statins. Monitoring and managing cardio health is crucial for overall well-being and can involve lifestyle changes, medication, and regular check-ups with a healthcare provider. Accurate and thorough documentation of cardio conditions and medications in a patient\\'s health record is important for providing comprehensive and effective care.\\n\\n\\n\\nExercise is a physical activity that is prescribed to improve overall health and wellbeing. It involves repetitive movements of the body, which increase heart rate and respiratory rate. Regular exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. It also helps to improve muscle strength, flexibility, and endurance. In this patient\\'s health record, exercise is recommended as a part of their treatment plan to manage their chronic condition and improve their overall health. The frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise will be tailored to their specific needs and abilities. Regular monitoring and tracking of their progress will be important to ensure the effectiveness of the exercise regimen. It is crucial for the patient to follow the prescribed exercise plan to achieve the desired health outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuality of life is a subjective measure of an individual\\'s overall well-being and satisfaction with their life. In the context of a patient health record, this term may refer to the impact that a specific condition or medication has on a patient\\'s daily life and overall functioning. Factors such as physical, emotional, and social well-being may be taken into account when assessing a patient\\'s quality of life. This information can be useful in determining the effectiveness of a treatment plan and making decisions about the patient\\'s care. It is important for healthcare providers to consider the quality of life of their patients in order to provide the best possible care and improve their overall health and well-being.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe patient reports experiencing difficulty falling and staying asleep, resulting in frequent awakenings throughout the night. This has been ongoing for several weeks and is impacting their daily functioning and overall well-being. The patient denies any significant stressors or changes in their routine that could be contributing to their sleep disturbances. They have tried over-the-counter sleep aids with minimal success. No other significant medical conditions or medications are reported. Based on these symptoms, the patient may be experiencing a sleep disorder and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to improve their quality of sleep and overall health.']\n",

      "  '\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nJohn Smith is a 45-year-old male patient who presents with several health conditions that require medical attention. He has been assigned the number 12345 for identification purposes. John\\'s medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. He is also currently taking several medications to manage these conditions. As a doctor, it is important to thoroughly assess John\\'s health and provide appropriate treatment to improve his overall well-being.\\n\\nDiabetes:\\n\\nJohn has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition that affects the body\\'s ability to produce and use insulin effectively. This is evident in his medical record as he has a \"1\" under the diabetes column. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications, including heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney failure.

To manage his blood pressure, John\\n\\n\\n\\nAnxiety is a mental health condition that is characterized by feelings of intense worry, fear, and nervousness. It is a common mental health disorder that can significantly impact a person\\'s daily life and well-being. The patient reports experiencing overwhelming feelings of anxiety, including racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, and physical symptoms such as increased heart rate and shortness of breath. The patient also reports having trouble sleeping and experiencing panic attacks. The patient has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and is currently being treated with medication and therapy to manage their symptoms. Regular follow-up appointments are recommended to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and make any necessary adjustments.\\n\\n \\n\\nBehavior refers to the actions and reactions of an individual in response to their environment. In a patient health record, behavior may be recorded as a symptom or side effect of a condition or medication. This can include changes in mood, agitation, aggression, or other behavioral changes that may impact the patient\\'s daily functioning and quality of life. It is important for healthcare providers to document any behavioral changes in a patient\\'s record in order to monitor their progress and adjust treatment as needed. In some cases, behavior may also be a primary concern and require specific interventions, such as therapy or medication, to address and manage effectively. Accurate and detailed documentation of behavior in a patient\\'s record is crucial for providing comprehensive and individualized care.\\n\\n\\n\\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme shifts in mood, energy levels, and behavior. This patient has a history of bipolar disorder, which has been managed with a combination of medication and therapy. They experience periods of intense mania, marked by elevated mood, impulsivity, and risk-taking behavior, as well as periods of deep depression, characterized by low mood, lack of motivation, and feelings of hopelessness. In order to manage their symptoms and maintain stability, this patient is currently taking a mood stabilizer and attends regular therapy sessions. They also have a safety plan in place to monitor their moods and seek help if necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\nDepression is a common mental health disorder that affects the patient\\'s mood, thoughts, and overall functioning. It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities that the patient used to enjoy. The patient may also experience changes in appetite and sleep patterns, difficulty concentrating, and low energy levels. In this patient\\'s health record, it is noted that they have been diagnosed with depression and are currently being treated with antidepressant medication. The patient reports feeling overwhelmed and having trouble coping with daily tasks. Regular therapy sessions and medication management are recommended to help manage their symptoms and improve their overall well-being.\\n\\n\\n\\nDrug-induced delirium, also known as medication-induced delirium, is a temporary state of confusion and disorientation caused by certain medications. This condition is often seen in patients who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. In the context of this patient\\'s health record, it is important to note any medications that may have contributed to their delirium, as well as any changes in their mental status or behavior. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of this condition is necessary to prevent further complications and ensure the patient\\'s safety. It is also important to review the patient\\'s medication regimen and consider adjusting any medications that may be causing or exacerbating the delirium. \\n\\n\\n\\nExercise is a form of physical activity that involves movement of the body and can range from light activities such as walking to more intense activities such as running or weightlifting. It is often recommended as a treatment or preventative measure for various health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Regular exercise has been shown to improve overall physical and mental well-being, increase muscle strength and flexibility, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. In this patient\\'s health record, exercise is listed as a prescribed treatment plan to manage their condition and improve their overall health. It is important for the patient to follow their exercise regimen as directed by their healthcare provider to achieve the desired health outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe patient\\'s condition has been noted as \"getting worse or not better\" in their health record. This means that despite treatment or interventions, the patient\\'s symptoms or overall health have not shown any improvement and may actually be deteriorating. This could be a concerning sign for the patient\\'s healthcare team, as it may indicate that the current course of treatment is not effective and may need to be adjusted. Further evaluation and monitoring may be necessary to determine the cause of the lack of improvement and to develop a new treatment plan. It is important for the patient to communicate any changes in their condition to their healthcare provider so that appropriate actions can be taken.\\n\\n\\n\\nHospital admission refers to the process of a patient being admitted to a hospital for medical treatment. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as a planned surgery, an emergency medical situation, or a worsening of a chronic condition. During a hospital admission, the patient\\'s vital signs and medical history are assessed, and they may undergo various diagnostic tests and receive treatments such as medications or procedures. The length of a hospital admission can vary depending on the patient\\'s condition and the type of care they require. Once the patient is stabilized and their condition improves, they may be discharged from the hospital. Hospital admission is documented in a patient\\'s health record to track their medical history and treatment. \\n\\n\\n\\nHospital readmission refers to the process of a patient being admitted to a hospital for treatment after being discharged from a previous hospital stay. This may occur due to a variety of reasons, such as complications from a previous treatment, a new medical issue, or the need for further monitoring or care. Hospital readmissions are often closely monitored and tracked in a patient\\'s health record, as they can indicate the effectiveness of the initial treatment and the overall health of the patient. In some cases, readmissions may be preventable through proper follow-up care and management of chronic conditions. It is important for healthcare providers to carefully review a patient\\'s health record and address any potential issues to reduce the likelihood of readmission.\\n\\n\\n\\nLong-term care refers to the ongoing medical and non-medical support provided to individuals who have chronic or long-term health conditions that prevent them from being fully independent. This type of care is typically provided in a residential setting, such as a nursing home or assisted living facility, and can include assistance with activities of daily living, medication management, and specialized medical treatments. In a patient health record, the documentation of long-term care would include information about the patient\\'s medical history, current health conditions, and specific care plans and treatments that have been prescribed by healthcare professionals. It is important for healthcare providers to regularly review and update the long-term care plan to ensure the patient\\'s needs are being met and their overall health is being monitored.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Mental Health Questionnaire is a diagnostic tool used to assess an individual\\'s mental health. It consists of a series of questions that evaluate a person\\'s thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and overall well-being. This questionnaire is often used in the context of a patient\\'s health record to gather information about their mental health history, symptoms, and any potential underlying issues. The results of this assessment can help healthcare professionals make a diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan for the patient. It is an important part of a patient\\'s health record as it provides valuable insight into their mental health status and helps guide their ongoing care. \\n\\n\\n\\nStress is a mental and emotional state that can have a significant impact on a patient\\'s overall health and well-being. It can be caused by a variety of factors, such as work, relationships, financial concerns, or health issues. Symptoms of stress may include anxiety, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and physical symptoms like headaches or muscle tension. In some cases, chronic stress can lead to more serious conditions such as depression or high blood pressure. Treatment for stress may involve lifestyle changes, therapy, or medication, depending on the severity and underlying causes. It is important for patients to address and manage their stress levels to prevent potential negative effects on their health.']]\n"
