    "The first step of this pipeline involves answering a prompt based on data. Specifically, this package is designed to take in structured data (in the form of a csv), as well as style supplements.  In querying a non-RAG like ChatGPT, the model often inserts unwanted context (e.g., history of a medication or disease, or its other uses not related to the patient's needs) that does not reflect the tone of true doctor's notes. This tool is designed to mitigate those effects, or to assess the future need for fine-tuning an LLM on patient data."
